We feel stuck in our pursuits of solving our money, health
and relationship problems because of the "Puzzle
mindset". ". It's thinking, "If only I can figure out this one
missing piece, everything else will fall into place".

This approach is deeply flawed as we overestimate the
impact of this one step and forget that there are endless
steps to become truly great at anything. The pressure to
make this great leap is so burdening that it causes in-
action and unclarity. Making us feel that we lack
something.

To overcome this trap, stop thinking of the problem as a
"Puzzle" that needs to be solved, instead start thinking of it
as a "Muscle" you can grow. This way, you lower the
pressure of figuring it out and focus more on showing up
each day, making incremental gains.
