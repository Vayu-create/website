I've noticed that my friend's who are building cool things have fallen prey to the 'big launch' scheme. It's a special technique
when you don't tell the world what you're building for months and then act suprised that world hasn't been magically notified
about your new thing. 

Attention is not a one shot event. Anyone who has the luxury of attention has built it piece by piece with force and intention.
If you believe whatever you're building is something that the world deserves, don't leave to one chance where the odds are stacked 
against you. 

Instead become that annoying friend who's always â€” soft launching. I discovered this phrase from Instagram girls who instead of fully
revealing their boyfriends, drop bits and pieces of cropped pictures that tease an idea that there might be someone else here. This 
drives so much curosity + softens the blow for when they actually announce their relationship. 

I can't believe I just explained soft launching. But I've really adopted that mindset with my products.I have a mental list of 15-20
people that are recieving staging links, half baked figma designs or low quality videos from me. I obviously enjoy this feedback loop
that allows me to be embrassing in private. But most importantly it kicks off the process of penetrating the attention market cap. 

Mordern day marketing BS has poisioned people who have just launched to act like a billion dollar mega corp to worry about their launch.
Remember that scene from The Social Network, where zuck pulls an all nighter then in the morning just emails his friends about his thing
that's how things should be. 

Remember to win your friend's first & then conquer the world.
