I had a very mathematical relationship with making money. I used to observe my income as some function of skills that are in demand and working hard. But that didn't get me anywhere, I was on the verge of becoming the person that thought probably luck is the only differentiating factor.

But everything changed for me financially when I learned about the concept of Money Wounds. I like to think of them as Limiting Beliefs that are not true but you picked them as a child and they now affect your financial view of things. If you saw your parents fighting over money you probably thought money ruins relationships, or if you saw a rich politician abuse his power, you'd feel money corrupts people. It doesn't have to be a big incident, it could simply be that the culture around of where you grew up, collectively had these BS ideas that you absorbed unknowingly.

Whatever the belief is, big or small it is stopping you from making a lot of money. Imagine wanting to be really rich but having the conflicting belief that rich people are all evil. Will this type of thinking work in your favour?

Or say while you pay all the taxi drivers, fruit vendors you try to haggle them for the lowest amount possible and think they are looting you but when you are about to be paid you absolutely hate people lowering your rate.

Finding and fixing your money wounds will make you richer than any business book or course can because all the business model and skills are fixable as they are in the outside world. But your blockers are inside you and only you can dig them and fix them.
