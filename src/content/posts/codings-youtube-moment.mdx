I'm seeing a lot of senior developers write of the Claude/Cursor & AI programming trend as they feel you cannot make anything 'serious' with it. It reminds when in the early days of YouTube, Hollywood directors wrote it off saying it wasn't like 'real movies'. They were right about YouTube not being the same as Hollywood, but they were mistaking being different for being lesser in value. Movies went from only being produced by rich who had expensive equipment to everyone with YouTube. I strongly feel coding is near it's YouTube moment

The YouTube Moment is specific era in time when:

1. Video hosting became free, earlier required setup and costed money
2. Editing became easier and mobile first
3. Phone cameras started becoming ridiculously good

This threatened the elite Hollywood club, as now everyone could be in it and they started making BS rules that gate kept what movies were 'real movies'.

Coding has gotten easier over the years with frameworks, template kits, no code and finally now AI. But the hosting bit remains largely unresolved. Taking your app live is still pretty hard and costs money. The ideal YT moment is when:

1. Hosting becomes one click and truly free forever.
2. No cap on bandwidth. There is some rev-share model like YouTube does
3. Less Intimidating and friendly UI; no terminals, or advanced features, just text to code mode and it does everything for you.

You could argue Replit is doing this but I find their brand very developer centric it's not very consumer and fun. Whoever makes consumer cursor will unlock a new app stores which has seen apps that have been never made before as the greatest leverage in the world â€” programming, gets commoditized
