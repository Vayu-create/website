When I was in school, I, like every other kid, was taught the pythagorean theorem.<br />
If I were to do the bare minimum [which I did] I just had to mug up a² + b² = c² and I would solve most of the mandatory problem sets for that chapter.

If I was a bit more curious, I would go through the algebraic proof.<br /><br />
If I was a total math nerd with the luxury of time at my hands, I would go over other proofs for the same theorem: Rearrangement proofs, Proof using similar triangles, Euclid's proof, Proofs by dissection and rearrangement, Proof by area-preserving shearing, Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement, etc.<br /><br />

But how beautiful it would have been if, in school, I had been taught how the Greeks stumbled upon this idea in the first place.
How they conceptualized numbers through geometric representations.
And how this intertwining of arithmetic with spatial understanding led to not only mathematical but architectural wonders.
And how it worked so well for them that when the concept of zero eventually traveled from India to Greece, they rejected it.
Not just because their geometry-obsessed, tangibility-focused minds struggled with the concept of nothingness, but because accepting it would have shattered their entire mathematical framework and worldview.<br /><br />

And how only if they would have entertained a new idea, they might even have stumbled on calculus.
Zeno’s paradox already took them to the edge.
And how it wasn’t until Fibonacci introduced the concept of zero back to Europe around the year 1202 and showed how efficient this number system can make calculations for the merchants that the idea of zero was accepted.<br /><br />

How beautiful it would have been if the true lesson of a² + b² = c² was the courage to question our worldview and scrutinize our own beliefs.
If the goal of learning wasn’t mistaken for merely solving a set of problems, but instead, instilling a fundamental sense of bravery in a child’s mind; the understanding that being open to new ideas and continuously reinventing oneself is not just okay, but essential.
Even when it means dismantling everything you thought you knew.<br /><br />

Maybe curiosity is a design problem.
Maybe good storytelling in education won’t just make people more curious but more earnest and well-rounded.
Maybe the biggest tragedy in education today is treating knowledge as fragmented pieces instead of one single, unfolding story.
Maybe we should be trained from a very young age to connect the dots.
