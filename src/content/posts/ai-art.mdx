To confuse Ghibli style images with art is an abomination. Art is context; Ghibli images are content. Until your arrangement of content is such that it incites a deep emotional response it is not art. Studio Ghibli is great not alone because of their art style but because of what those films made us feel.

The art style was a carefully calibrated instrument designed to evoke that response when harmonized with the other elements and the larger tapestry of context. These Ghibli style images being produced today will be forgotten very soon, as all irrelevant things do.</br></br>

But what AI has blessed us with is the ability to rapidly prototype our imagination. Something that will accelerate creation of both good and bad art â€“ yes, art is objective. No amount of AI will help someone unwilling to put in the effort to imagine how each color, brushstroke, space, texture, sequence of images, or note of music will shape the emotional response they tend to evoke.

But for those willing to think, AI is a lever. It will help them see further, try more, and refine faster. Art, like the rest of the world, is slowly shifting to a thinking economy.
